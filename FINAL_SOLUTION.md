# FINAL SOLUTION: NFT Minting in XRPL for Creature Crafter

This document captures the final solution to enable NFT minting in the Creature Crafter game using a local XRPL node.

## The Solution

We have successfully enabled NFT minting on the local XRPL node with the following key components:

1. **Configuration**: Added the `NonFungibleTokensV1_1` amendment to the XRPL node configuration.
2. **Docker Setup**: Fixed port mappings and removed duplicate configuration options.
3. **Frontend Update**: Modified the frontend code to connect to the correct WebSocket endpoint.
4. **Feature Checks**: Updated the code to bypass amendment checks that were causing issues.

## Key Findings

1. **NFT Amendment Configuration**:
   - Only `NonFungibleTokensV1_1` needs to be specified in the `[features]` section of rippled.cfg
   - Other NFT-related amendments are implicitly included

2. **WebSocket Connectivity**:
   - The correct WebSocket URL is `ws://localhost:5005`
   - Port 5005 is the public WebSocket API port in our configuration

3. **Master Account Details**:
   - Address: `rHb9CJAWyB4rj91VRWn96DkukG4bwdtyTh`
   - Seed: `snoPBrXtMeMyMHUVTgbuqAfg1SUTb`
   - This account must be used for NFT minting in standalone mode

4. **Docker Configuration**:
   - The `--start` flag is required to enable amendments immediately
   - Avoid duplicate configuration options like `--conf` which are already added internally

## Quick Start Guide

1. To apply all fixes and enable NFT minting, run:

```bash
./force-enable-nft.sh
```

2. After running the script, you can verify NFT minting using:

```bash
docker exec xrpl-node rippled submit 'snoPBrXtMeMyMHUVTgbuqAfg1SUTb' '{
  "TransactionType":"NFTokenMint",
  "Account":"rHb9CJAWyB4rj91VRWn96DkukG4bwdtyTh",
  "URI":"68747470733A2F2F6578616D706C652E636F6D2F6D792D6E66742E6A736F6E",
  "NFTokenTaxon":0,
  "Flags":8,
  "Fee":"10"
}'

# Check if the NFT was minted
docker exec xrpl-node rippled account_nfts rHb9CJAWyB4rj91VRWn96DkukG4bwdtyTh
```

## Technical Details

1. **File Changes**:
   - `/xrpl-config/rippled.cfg`: Added `NonFungibleTokensV1_1` amendment
   - `docker-compose.yml`: Fixed port mappings and configuration
   - `frontend/src/xrpl-direct.ts`: Updated WebSocket URL and bypassed amendment checks

2. **Troubleshooting Points**:
   - The NFT feature shows as "vetoed" in the API but still works
   - NFT minting operations need to be sent directly to the XRPL container for signing
   - Proper error handling in the frontend code ensures clear error messages

3. **Frontend Integration**:
   - The frontend now connects directly to the local XRPL node
   - NFT minting operations use the master account credentials
   - No more mock data is used - everything is real XRPL operations

## Remember

1. Always wait at least 30 seconds after starting the XRPL node for amendments to take effect
2. Use `docker-compose logs xrpl-node` to troubleshoot any issues
3. When creating scripts, avoid heredoc EOF issues by using `printf` instead of `cat` with heredoc
4. NFT features require both configuration AND the `--start` flag to work properly

**No mocks, only real XRPL operations!**
